
                       THE ONLINE GREEK NEW TESTAMENT
            DECLENSION CODES FOR NOUNS, ADJECTIVES, PREPOSITIONS,
                         CONJUNCTIONS AND PARTICLES

                    Derived, compared and corrected from
                   the Bagster "Analytical Greek Lexicon,"
                       with comparison made against
                Perschbacher's "New Analytical Greek Lexicon"

               Abbreviated in a form similar to that found in
                 Friberg's "Analytical Greek New Testament"

  The codes which follow reflect an original abridgment and correction
  of the data presented in "The Analytical Greek Lexicon" (London:
  Samuel Bagster and Sons, 1859).

  Comparison also has been made against the revised updating of that
  lexicon by Wesley J. Perschbacher in his "The New Analytical Greek
  Lexicon" (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1990). The Perschbacher revision
  failed to adjust over 600 parsing or declensional errors in the
  original Bagster edition; these now have been corrected.

  The abbreviation system was developed independently. Its features are
  similar to those in Timothy and Barbara Friberg "The Analytical Greek
  New Testament" (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1981), and can be used readily
  by anyone familiar with the Bagster lexicon, Perschbacher, or
  Friberg.

  Many Greek New Testament non-verbal forms (nouns, adjectives,
  conjunctions, prepositions, and particles) can be interpreted in more
  than one way. The declensions presented reflect a normal
  interpretation of those forms which actually occur in the Greek New
  Testament. Every NT occurrence is covered, and the declensions
  reflect the totality of Greek NT non-verbal forms.

  The data presented are not claimed to be free from error; the editor
  may be notified of any problem regarding the parsing, declension, or
  Strong's number assigned to any word, at SEBTS, P. O. Box 1889, Wake
  Forest, NC 27588 or <mrobinson@sebts.edu>.

  ADDITIONAL NOTES:

    Declined proper nouns are not specifically identified as being
    names of persons or places; only indeclinable forms are so
    identified.

    Reflexive pronouns have the Person (1,2,3) attached, e.g. F-3DSF
    See "auth" in the Bagster or Perschbacher lexicon for further
    examples.

    Possessive adjectives have the Person (1,2,3) and number (S,P)
    attached, e.g. S-2PDSM for "umeterw". See "emov", "sov", "hmterov"
    and "umeterov" in the Bagster or Perschbacher lexicon for further
    examples.


  SEARCHING FOR WORDS USING THE PARSING CODES:

    All parsing and declension code information for the Greek NT text
    appears in CAPITAL letters while the Greek text appears entirely
    in lower case letters. Case-sensitive searching allows one to use
    lower case to search for Greek words (with or without wildcards),
    and upper case to search by parsing or declension (also with or
    without wildcards). With Boolean search capabilities, lower and
    upper case search requests can be combined to select Greek forms in
    association with specified parsing or declension information.

    To search across hyphenated portions of the declension (e.g.,
    N-GSM), such must be stated as a "phrase search" request. To search
    for N-GSM, one must seek the phrase "N GSM" or "N-GSM" (hyphens are
    disregarded).

    While one could search for all forms of "logov" by "log*" or for
    all Genitive plural nouns by "GPM | GPM | GPN", one must request a
    fully inclusive PHRASE SEARCH in order to link a word to its own
    declension. This request normally will include the preliminary
    part-of-speech identifier (N-, A-, or V-). E.g., to seek all
    genitive plural forms of "logov", the phrase search request could
    be rendered as either "log* N-GPM | log* N-GPF | log* N-GPN" or
    "log* N-GP*"

    The Strong's numbers also may be used in searches. This will reduce
    the time and space otherwise needed to frame various requests.
    E.g., a phrase search for all genitive plural forms of "logov"
    could also be set by either "3056 & N-GPM | N-GPF | N-GPN" or "3056
    & N-GP*".

    Wherever the Strong's number is preceded by a zero entry <0>, this
    indicates that in the Greek edition currently being examined there
    is no corresponding Strong's number for this word (Strong's numbers
    are based solely upon the Textus Receptus edition), and the number
    assigned is at best the closest to the actual root (this adaptation
    is currently in progress).

    To search for phrases based solely on grammatical analysis (e.g.,
    all prepositional phrases followed by an articular neuter genitive
    noun), the wildcard (*) symbol should precede each requested
    parsing within a phrase search request (e.g., "* PREP * T-GSN *
    N-GSN").


  STRONG'S NUMBERS:

    To access the lexical root form definition of any Greek word, the
    appropriate Strong's concordance number immediately follows each
    Greek word. The definition then can be obtained by the normal
    routine for definitions as used for English texts.

    The Strong's numbers used for the Greek New Testament do NOT always
    coincide with those used in the English texts. Strong clearly
    assisted the lay reader of the Authorized Version by assigning
    numbers to each unique root word form; however, he also attempted
    further to aid the reader by subdividing some root forms into
    separately numbered entries.

    The result of such subdivision can be seen in the multiple forms of
    the verb "to be" (each of which ultimately derives from Strong's
    1510). The same policy of separate numerical entries also was
    applied to various comparative and superlative forms of some
    adjectives and adverbs, as well as to the adverbial use of some
    noun forms.

    Conversely, rather than treating each word separately (as would
    have been proper for anyone able to read the Greek), Strong
    assigned a single unique number to certain multiple-word 
    expressions (e.g., "ou mh" or "ei de mhge"). Such a number no
    longer was reflective of the individual root forms. Once more, this
    action was taken by Strong in order to assist the lay English
    reader who knew no Greek; in practice this policy becomes a severe
    hindrance to those who know and seek to read and understand the New
    Testament in its original Koine Greek.

    Thus, the Strong's numbers -- well-suited as they may be for the
    lay reader of the English text -- in places become confusing and
    detrimental to those reading the Greek New Testament who would use
    those numbers when searching for or classifying the ultimate
    lexical root forms of various Greek words.

    The present Greek edition attempts to alter Strong's Greek word 
    numbers so that they relate directly to their ultimate practical 
    root form where possible. For example, all forms of the irregular 
    second aorist root "eipon" (Strong's 2036) now are assigned to the 
    root "legw" (Strong's 3004), to which "eipon" functions as the 
    practical aorist. Similarly, all derived forms of "eidon" 
    (originally included within Strong's 1492) now are related 
    appropriately to either "oraw" (Strong's 3708) or "oida" (Strong's 
    1492), in accordance with their particular meaning. However, in 
    some cases (e. g., mhge), a Strong's original phrase-based number
    has been retained to identify the particular single word that
    otherwise would have no unique Strong's number.

    In some cases, new words exist within the Koine Greek text that had 
    not appeared in the Textus Receptus upon which Strong's numbering 
    system had been based. In such cases, the new word is located 
    either under a relatively appropriate Strong's number, or has been 
    assigned a Strong's number that otherwise would no longer exist, 
    due to consolidation under the root lexical forms. One case in 
    particular is that of "ekperissou" and "ekperisswv," neither of 
    which exist separately in the TR: these have been assigned the 
    Strong's numbers 4053 and 4057, thus retaining a single common 
    root, and that in close relation to other words containing some 
    form of "periss-".

    The revision of the Strong's numbers within the Greek NT text is an
    ongoing process. Ultimately all Strong's numbers in the Greek text
    will agree with the Greek lexical root form.


    Note that it is ASSUMED that most Strong's numbers are correct;
    these have not been verified, although many errors have been noted
    and corrected.
