                   PARSING CODES FOR VERB-RELATED FORMS

                   Derived, compared and corrected from
                  the Bagster "Analytical Greek Lexicon,"
                       with comparison made against
               Perschbacher's "New Analytical Greek Lexicon"

              Abbreviated in a form similar to that found in
                Friberg's "Analytical Greek New Testament"

  The codes which follow reflect an original abridgment and correction
  of the data presented in "The Analytical Greek Lexicon" (London:
  Samuel Bagster and Sons, 1859).

  Comparison also has been made against the revised updating of that
  lexicon by Wesley J. Perschbacher in his "The New Analytical Greek
  Lexicon" (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1990). The Perschbacher revision
  failed to adjust over 600 parsing or declensional errors in the
  original Bagster edition; these now have been corrected.

  The abbreviation system was developed independently. Its features are
  similar to those in Timothy and Barbara Friberg "The Analytical Greek
  New Testament" (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1981), and can be used readily
  by anyone familiar with the Bagster lexicon, Perschbacher, or
  Friberg.

  Many Greek New Testament verbal forms can be parsed in more than one
  manner. The parsings given reflect a normal interpretation of those
  forms which actually occur in the Greek New Testament. Every NT
  occurrence is covered, and the parsings reflect the totality of Greek
  NT verbal forms.

  The data presented are not claimed to be free from error; the editor
  may be notified of any problem regarding the parsing, declension, or
  Strong's number assigned to any word, at SEBTS, P. O. Box 1889, Wake
  Forest, NC 27588 or <mrobinson@sebts.edu>.

  All Greek verbs are listed in one of three various forms (where V = 
  "Verb"):

       1) V-tense-voice-mood
       2) V-tense-voice-mood-person-number
       3) V-tense-voice-mood-case-number-gender

  The abbreviations which pertain to each of these categories are the
  following:


    Tense: P          = Present
           I          = Imperfect
           F          = Future             Second Future     = 2F
           A          = Aorist             Second Aorist     = 2A
           R          = peRfect            Second peRfect    = 2R
           L          = pLuperfect         Second pLuperfect = 2L

    Voice: A          = Active
           M          = Middle
           P          = Passive
           E          = Either middle or passive
           D          = middle Deponent
           O          = passive depOnent
           N          = middle or passive depoNent

    Mood:  I          = Indicative
           S          = Subjunctive
           O          = Optative
           M          = iMperative
           N          = iNfinitive
           P          = Participle

    Extra: -ATT       = Attic Greek form

    Person: 1, 2, 3   = First, Second, Third person

    Number: S, P      = Singular, Plural

    Gender: M, F, N   = Masculine, Feminine, Neuter

    Case:  N          = Nominative     (5-case system only; no Vocative
           G          = Genitive         in verbal forms)
           D          = Dative
           A          = Accusative



  SEARCHING FOR WORDS USING THE PARSING CODES:

    All parsing and declension code information for the Greek NT text
    appears in CAPITAL letters while the Greek text appears entirely in
    lower case letters. Case-sensitive searching allows one to use
    lower case to search for Greek words (with or without wildcards),
    and upper case to search by parsing or declension (also with or
    without wildcards). With Boolean search capabilities, lower and
    upper case search requests can be combined to select Greek forms in
    association with specified parsing or declension information.

    To search across hyphenated portions of the parsing (e.g.,
    V-PAI-3S), such must be stated as a "phrase search" request. To
    search for V-PAI-3S, one must seek the phrase "V PAI 3S" or
    "V-PAI-3S" (hyphens are disregarded).

    While one could search for all forms of "legw" by "leg* | eleg*",
    or for all Present Active Indicative forms by "PAI", one must
    request a fully inclusive PHRASE SEARCH in order to link a word to
    its own parsing. This request normally will include the preliminary
    part-of-speech identifier (V-, N-, or A-). E.g., to seek all
    Present Active Indicative forms of "legw" the phrase search request
    would be rendered as "leg* V-PAI".

    The Strong's numbers also may be used in searches. This will reduce 
    the time and space otherwise needed to frame various requests.  
    E.g., a phrase search for all Present Indicative Active forms of 
    "legw" would be set by "3004 V-PAI". 

    Wherever the Strong's number is preceded by a zero entry <0>, this
    indicates that in the Greek edition currently being examined there
    is no corresponding Strong's number for this word (Strong's numbers
    are based solely upon the Textus Receptus edition), and the number
    assigned is at best the closest to the actual root (this adaptation 
    is currently in progress).

    To search for phrases based solely on grammatical analysis (e.g.,
    all verbal forms preceded by a conjunction), the wildcard (*)
    symbol should precede each requested parsing within a phrase search
    request (e.g., "* CONJ * V-*").

    SPECIAL NOTE: the so-called "Second" forms of the Aorist, Future,
    Perfect and Pluperfect are respectively designated as 2A, 2F, 2P
    and 2L, preceding the voice and mood designations. Functionally,
    these forms are equivalent to the undesignated (First) Aorist,
    Future, Perfect, and Pluperfect forms.

    Search requests which are intended to include BOTH the first and
    second forms of either the Aorist, Future, Perfect or Pluperfect
    MUST be prefixed with an asterisk (*). Failure to use the wildcard
    prefix will result in the second tense forms NOT being found.

    Example: to search for all Perfect Active Indicative forms (both
    RAI and 2RAI), the wildcard *RAI should be used. Similarly, to
    search for all Aorist Active Subjunctive forms, (AAS and 2AAS), the
    wildcard *AAS should be used.


  STRONG'S NUMBERS:

    To access the lexical root form definition of any Greek word, the
    appropriate Strong's concordance number immediately follows each
    Greek word. The definition then can be obtained by the normal
    routine for definitions as used for English texts.

    The Strong's numbers used for the Greek New Testament do NOT always
    coincide with those used in the English texts. Strong clearly
    assisted the lay reader of the Authorized Version by assigning
    numbers to each unique root word form; however, he also attempted
    further to aid the reader by subdividing some root forms into
    separately numbered entries.

    The result of such subdivision can be seen in the multiple forms of
    the verb "to be" (each of which ultimately derives from Strong's
    1510). The same policy of separate numerical entries also was
    applied to various comparative and superlative forms of some
    adjectives and adverbs, as well as to the adverbial use of some
    noun forms.

    Conversely, rather than treating each word separately (as would
    have been proper for anyone able to read the Greek), Strong
    assigned a single unique number to certain multiple-word
    expressions (e.g., "ou mh" or "ei de mhge"). Such a number no
    longer was reflective of the individual root forms. Once more, this
    action was taken by Strong in order to assist the lay English
    reader who knew no Greek; in practice this policy becomes a severe
    hindrance to those who know and seek to read and understand the New
    Testament in its original Koine Greek.

    Thus, the Strong's numbers -- well-suited as they may be for the
    lay reader of the English text -- in places become confusing and
    detrimental to those reading the Greek New Testament who would use
    those numbers when searching for or classifying the ultimate
    lexical root forms of various Greek words.

    The present Greek edition often alters Strong's Greek word numbers
    so that they relate directly to their ultimate practical root form
    where possible. For example, all forms of the irregular second
    aorist root "eipon" (Strong's 2036) now are assigned to the root
    "legw" (Strong's 3004), to which "eipon" functions as the practical
    aorist. Similarly, all derived forms of "eidon" (originally
    included within Strong's 1492) now are related appropriately to
    either "oraw" (Strong's 3708) or "oida" (Strong's 1492), in
    accordance with their particular meaning. However, in some cases
    (e. g., mhge), a Strong's original phrase-based number has been
    retained to identify the particular single word that otherwise
    would have no unique Strong's number.

    In some cases, new words exist within the Koine Greek text that had 
    not appeared in the Textus Receptus upon which Strong's numbering 
    system had been based. In such cases, the new word is prefixed by a 
    <0> entry, and located either under a relatively appropriate 
    Strong's number, or has been assigned a Strong's number that 
    otherwise would no longer exist, due to root consolidation. One 
    case in particular is that of "ekperissou" and "ekperisswv," 
    neither of which exist separately in the TR: these have been 
    assigned the Strong's numbers 4053 and 4057, thus retaining a 
    single common root, and that in close relation to other words 
    containing some form of "periss-".

    The revision of the Strong's numbers within the Greek NT text is an
    ongoing process. Ultimately all Strong's numbers in the Greek text
    will agree with the Greek lexical root form.

    Note that it is ASSUMED that all Strong's numbers are correct;
    these have not been verified, although many errors have been noted
    and corrected.


                          ADDITIONAL NOTES:

              THE VARIOUS FORMS OF THE VERB "TO BE":

    Although the analytical lexicons state no voice for the various
    forms of "to be" (including compound verbs in which "-eimi" is an
    element), for the purposes of the current parsing data ALL such
    forms are considered to be in the ACTIVE voice.

    In addition, Strong's Concordance gives unique numbers to many
    separate forms of the verb "to be", even though all these properly
    derive from "eimi" (1510) alone. Perschbacher gives both numbers:
    the particular Strong's number in the left margin and the root
    number 1510 in the right margin. In the present electronic Greek NT
    texts, ALL forms of "eimi" reflect the single number 1510.

    Since accents and breathings are not provided in these Greek texts,
    some word forms will appear identical although possessing distinct
    parsings or declensions. The following specifically should be
    noted:

      The form "h" occurs infrequently as part of the verb "to be"
      (V-PAS-3S of 1510, numbered 5600 by Strong); the same form
      reflecting the definite article (3588), relative pronoun (3739),
      and disjunctive particle (2228, 2229) dominates within the Greek
      NT.

      The form "ei" also occurs infrequently as part of the verb "to
      be" (V-PAI-2S of 1510, numbered 1488 by Strong); the same form
      (in the absence of accents and breathings) occurs most frequently
      as a conditional particle (1487).

      The form "hn" is frequent as a verb form in the Greek NT
      (V-IAI-3S of 1510, numbered 2258 by Strong); it also occurs
      frequently as a relative pronoun (3739).

      The subjunctive verb form "wsin" (V-PAS-3P of 1510) is
      incorrectly cited by Strong as participial (5607). Note also that
      the same form may be a plural noun from 3775.

      The verb form "hv" can be either a present subjunctive (PAS-2S,
      Strong 1510) or an imperfect indicative (V-IAI-2S, Strong 2229).
      Both forms derive from the root 1510; the parsing information
      following each form makes the distinction clear.
